        <h2>What is Water Conservation</h2>
        <p>
          Water conservation is using water efficiently to reduce waste of water
          and overuse of water. Making the decision to conserve water will have
          an impact on many problems. Preservation and control of water will
          help improve the quality of water, pollution, save energy, droughts
          and many more.
